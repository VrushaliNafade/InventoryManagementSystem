# InventoryManagementSystem
Inventory Management System can be used for purchasing and keeping the updates of the purchased items in any grocery mall or can be used in any kind of shops.

In this system, we can add items manually and also can append in the product list. While purchasing it will first display the list of items available in the shop and then after by entering the product ID and quantity we can purchase that item and also it will update the purchase made in the Records.json file and also in Sales.json file.
